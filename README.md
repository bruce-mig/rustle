# Rustle
Rustle is a simple and fun guessing game written in Rust. The game generates a secret number between 1 and 100 and challenges the player to guess it in as few attempts as possible. The game provides feedback on whether the playerâ€™s guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game also keeps track of the number of guesses and displays the final score at the end.

## How to play
To play Rustle, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can download Rust from here. Once you have Rust, you can clone this repository and run the game with the following commands:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bruce-mig/rustle.git
    cd rustle
    cargo run
```

The game will prompt you to enter your name and then start the guessing game. You can enter your guess as a number between 1 and 100 and press enter. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct. You can keep guessing until you find the secret number. The game will also show you how many guesses you have made so far. When you guess the secret number, the game will congratulate you and show you your final score.
